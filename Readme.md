# Elm Resume

A resume based off of Robert Cobb's tutorial [Make A Resume Website From Scratch](https://medium.com/@robcobbable/make-a-resume-website-from-scratch-991845147ec) in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/). This code was created as an example to motivate me to work through learning basic concepts in Elm and was not meant to serve as an example of how to use Elm in a production application. My hope is that it will be achievable learning experience and perhaps some of these pieces can be resused as basic static resume site generator or a package for working with resume data in Elm.

# Getting started

1. Run `elm reactor` from the command line in the root folder to start the built in Elm web server.
2. Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) to load up the example resume rendered using Elm.
3. Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/original.html](http://localhost:8000/original.html) to see the original static HTML version of the resume page as a comparison.
